## Database Schema

### New Tables

#### `shops`
- `id` (UUID, PK)
- `name` (String, required)
- `description` (Text)
- `address` (String)
- `latitude` (Float, required)
- `longitude` (Float, required)
- `phone_number`, `email`, `website` (String)
- `category`, `operating_hours` (String)
- `is_active` (Boolean)
- `created_at`, `updated_at`, `deleted_at` (DateTime)

#### `cta_events`
- `id` (UUID, PK)
- `user_id` (UUID, FK -> users, nullable)
- `event_type` (String, indexed)
- `event_context` (String)
- `related_entity_id` (UUID)
- `related_entity_type` (String)
- `metadata` (JSON)
- `ip_address`, `user_agent` (String)
- `created_at`, `updated_at` (DateTime)

#### `apartments`
- `id` (UUID, PK)
- `name` (String, required)
- `address` (String, required)

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Run Database Migration
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

### 2. Create Apartment Admin Users
```bash
# Promote a user to apartment admin
python -m scripts.setup_apartment_admin user@example.com

# List all apartment admins
python -m scripts.setup_apartment_admin --list
```

### 3. Test the APIs
Use the examples in `NEW_FEATURES.md` to test each endpoint.

## Role-Based Access Control

| Role | Description | Permissions |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `user` | Regular user | Track CTA events, view shops |
| `admin` | Super administrator | All shop, analytics, and apartment management |
| `apartment_admin` | Apartment manager | Manage vehicles in assigned apartments |

---

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: All sensitive endpoints require Firebase authentication
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control enforced at dependency level
3. **Soft Deletes**: Data is never permanently deleted (forensics/audit trail)
4. **Anonymous Tracking**: CTA events can be tracked without auth (privacy-friendly)
5. **Input Validation**: All inputs validated via Pydantic schemas
6. **SQL Injection**: Protected by SQLAlchemy ORM
7. **Rate Limiting**: Recommended to add rate limiting for CTA tracking endpoint
